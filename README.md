# Project Overview

This project is structured to support both Python and TypeScript development. The following directories are included:

- **library/**: Contains Python code and related files.
- **src/**: Contains TypeScript code.
- **scripts/**: Contains shell scripts for environment management and other tasks.

## Directory Structure

- **library/**
  - `src/`: Source code for the Python library.
  - `tests/`: Test files for the Python library.
  - `docs/`: Documentation for the Python library.

- **src/**: TypeScript source code.

- **scripts/**: Shell scripts for managing the environment and other tasks.

## Folder Purposes and Relationships

- **library/**: This directory is dedicated to Python development. It includes the main source code, tests, and documentation for the Python library. The `src/` subdirectory contains the core Python modules, while `tests/` holds unit and integration tests. The `docs/` folder provides detailed documentation for the library.

- **src/**: This directory houses the TypeScript code, which forms the main application logic. It is designed to work in conjunction with the Python library, enabling cross-language functionality.

- **scripts/**: This directory contains shell scripts that facilitate environment setup, management, and verification. These scripts ensure that both Python and TypeScript environments are correctly configured and maintained.

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up the project and running the code will be provided in the documentation files within each directory.

## Progress Tracking

A progress tracking file will be maintained to document the current status, completed items, pending items, dependencies, and next steps.
