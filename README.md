# Project Overview

This project is structured to support both Python and TypeScript development, implementing an image processing pipeline with cross-language integration.

## Directory Structure

üìÅ Project Root

- [üìÅ **library/**](library/README.md): Python library implementation
  - `src/`: Source code for the Python library
  - `tests/`: Test files for the Python library
  - `docs/`: Documentation for the Python library
- [üìÅ **src/**](src/README.md): TypeScript implementation
- [üìÅ **scripts/**](scripts/README.md): Environment management scripts
- `progress.md`: Project progress tracking
- `tasks.txt`: Task management
- `cline.md`: AI agent instructions
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: GitHub Copilot instructions and preferences

## Documentation Structure

Each directory contains its own README.md with specific documentation:

- [Library Documentation](library/README.md): Python library implementation details
- [Source Documentation](src/README.md): TypeScript code structure and components
- [Scripts Documentation](scripts/README.md): Environment management and utilities
- [Copilot Instructions](.github/copilot-instructions.md): GitHub Copilot instructions and preferences

## Folder Purposes and Relationships

### [Library Directory](library/README.md)
